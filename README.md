Design a C# program to parse notification titles and assign them to different channels.
The notification titles contain multiple tags, each enclosed in square brackets and separated by square brackets. Each tag represents a different notification channel, which may include Backend (BE), Frontend (FE), Quality Assurance (QA), and Urgent (Urgent).

Write a program to analyze the title, identify valid tags associated with notification channels, and list those notification channels.
